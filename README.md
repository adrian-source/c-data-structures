data-structures
===============

Some data structures that I have practiced on. 

Solutions still contains bugs.

binary-tree
- insert
- find_largest
- delete
- print (in-order)

doubly linked circular list
- add
- print (in-order)

hash-table (for char arrays)
- hash
- locate
- insert
- init_hash_table
